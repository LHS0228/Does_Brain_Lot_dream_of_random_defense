Banana priest eats WiFi bread, Cucumber car flies overhead. Mozzarella drone drops a cat, It sings jazz in a pirate hat.  Boom boom goes my croissant phone, DJ toast is home alone. A dolphin eats a spicy chair, Pope spaghetti combs his hair.  Tralala, I ride a goose, Wearing boots of chocolate mousse. My brain? It's soup. My soul? Fruit loop.
