# Does Brain Lot dream of random defense?
Tralalero Tralala,
I woke up in a microwave in downtown Osaka.
Grandma was doing push-ups on a pizza,
Screaming “Bambino! The moon is made of Fanta!”

I ran outside wearing crocs made of salami,
My neighbor — a lobster — screamed “Call my mommy!”
So I rode a flaming spaghetti tsunami,
Right into the arms of Doctor Origami Tsukuyomi.

Boom boom goes the cheese grenade,
A dancing avocado holds a lemonade blade.
He says, “I’m the final boss of 7-Eleven space,”
And disappears into a ramen-flavored haze.

Meanwhile...
President Cappuccino fights Pope Macaroni,
In a helicopter made of rigatoni.
Their weapons?
A fork, a spoon, and a cursed pepperoni.

Then enters the GOD OF NOISE:
DJ Mozzarella, riding a bread Rolls Royce.
He drops the beat with nuclear bass,
Summoning ghosts from the mayonnaise.

The sky turns green, the cows start singing,
A jellyfish banker starts wedding ring blinging.
I look at my hand — it’s a churro sword.
My IQ is now... negative four.

Suddenly, a banana in a tuxedo descends,
He whispers:

"Your brain... has officially rotted.
Your thoughts... are spaghetti knotted.
Your life... is a croissant that’s been plotted."

The world explodes into jazz and cheese,
The moon is replaced with frozen peas.
And I — now a toaster with Wi-Fi and pride —
Scream, “TRALALERO TRALALAAAAA”
...and ride into the gravy tide.
